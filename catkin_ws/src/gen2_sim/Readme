gen2_sim package
================

This package contains the necessary .world, .launch, and map files for initializing
the stage simulator for use with ROS.  Each launch file loads a seperate configuration
for simulation.  The robots use the "diff" odometry model and are outfitted with a "ranger"
model to simulate a standard Hokuyo Laser Range Finder.

Folders:
launch: .launch files used by roslaunch
maps:	.pgm map files for stage
worlds:	stage .world configuration files

Dependencies:
stage
